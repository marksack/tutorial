# README

This is an implementation of the professional-grade sample application from
the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (4th edition) (http://www.railstutorial.org/) by Michael Hartl.

It deviates from the book in the following ways:

* Rails 5.2.2.1 instead of 5.1.4
* Ruby 2.6.2
* Bootstrap 4.3.1 instead of 3.3.7
* Active Storage instead of Carrierwave
* Mailcatcher https://mailcatcher.me/ instead of mail previews and Heroku
* Implementation of exercises (for the most part)
* Different test data for fixtures
